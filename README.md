This is a 3D simulation of the solar system built with Three.js. It shows the Sun at the center, with all 8 planets orbiting around it, rendered with realistic textures and 3D orbital movement. 

The project includes:

1. Realistic Sun and planet textures
2. Dashed orbit lines to visualize planetary orbits
3. Starfield background
4. Adjustable orbital speeds using sliders
5. Pause/Resume animation feature
6. Hover tooltips displaying each planet’s name
7. Dark/Light theme toggle
8. Fully responsive design for modern browsers
